# Configuration

Plugin configuration lives at `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` (outside the plugin directory).

## Setup

```bash
# Create config directory
mkdir -p ~/.bitwize-music

# Copy template from plugin
cp config/config.example.yaml ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml

# Edit with your settings
nano ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml
```

## Why Outside the Plugin?

When you install via `/plugin install`, the plugin lives in `~/.claude/plugins/`. Putting config in `~/.bitwize-music/` means:

1. **Easy access** - Always at the same location
2. **Survives updates** - Plugin updates don't overwrite your config
3. **Works everywhere** - Same config whether you cloned the repo or installed as plugin

## Config File Reference

### `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml`

```yaml
# Artist info
artist:
  name: "your-artist-name"
  genres:
    - "electronic"
    - "hip-hop"

# Paths (all support ~ for home directory)

```

### Tools Directory

The `~/.bitwize-music/` directory also contains:

```
~/.bitwize-music/
├── config.yaml         # Your configuration
├── mastering-env/      # Shared Python venv for mastering
└── cache/              # Future: cache files
```

## Missing Config

If Claude can't find `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml`, it will prompt:

```
Config not found. Run:
  mkdir -p ~/.bitwize-music
  cp config/config.example.yaml ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml
Then edit ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml with your settings.
```

## Overrides System

The overrides directory lets you customize any skill or workflow without plugin update conflicts.

### How It Works

**Single directory, per-skill files:**
```bash
~/music-projects/overrides/
├── CLAUDE.md                 # Override base workflow instructions
├── pronunciation-guide.md    # Override base pronunciation guide
├── explicit-words.md         # Custom explicit word list (future)
├── lyric-writing-guide.md    # Custom lyric writing preferences (future)
└── mastering-presets.yaml    # Custom mastering settings (future)
```

**Each skill checks for its own override:**
1. Skill reads `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` → `paths.overrides`
2. Checks for `{overrides}/[filename].md`
3. If exists: merge with base (or replace, depending on skill)
4. If not exists: use base only (no error)

### Setup

```bash
# Create overrides directory
mkdir -p ~/music-projects/overrides

# Add any override files you want
touch ~/music-projects/overrides/CLAUDE.md
touch ~/music-projects/overrides/pronunciation-guide.md
```
